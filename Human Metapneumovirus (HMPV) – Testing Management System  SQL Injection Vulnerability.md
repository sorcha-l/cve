Vulnerability File: 

/hmpv-tms/login.php

Description:

A SQL injection vulnerability exists in the login functionality of the `login.php` page. An attacker can bypass the normal authentication mechanism by entering a malicious SQL statement (e.g., `' OR 1=1 -- `) in the username input field and entering any value or leaving the password field blank. After clicking the login button, the system will execute the modified SQL query, allowing the attacker to log in directly and be redirected to the `dashboard.php` page.

This vulnerability may allow attackers to access the system without valid credentials, thereby obtaining sensitive information (such as user data and business data) and performing malicious operations on the database (such as modifying or deleting data), posing a serious threat to the security and stability of the system.

[+] payload:

```
' OR 1=1 -- 
```
